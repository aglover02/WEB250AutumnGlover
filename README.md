This is a simple PHP-based website that shows content based on URL routing. The index.html file is the homepage, which presents a menu of links to different lessons and a final project page. The routing logic is in router.php, which has the corresponding lesson file based on the URL path. A 404.html page is also included for invalid routes. The website is styled using the styles.css file. This webpage shows basic PHP functionality and URL routing, along with Docker integration for deployment.

In this session, I used PHP to handle user input from forms and perform calculations like unit conversions. I also practiced using PHP functions to process GET and POST requests and validate input and output results. I plan to apply this knowledge to my educational goals for web development by using these skills in future projects. Understanding server-side scripting is crucial and will open up career opportunities in backend development.
