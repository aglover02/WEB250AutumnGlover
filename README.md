Hi. I’m taking WEB250 because it’s a part of my Web Development degree, and it’s important to understand how websites function beyond just the front-end. Learning server-side scripting will help me create interactive websites that handle user accounts, data storage, and custom features. It's an important skill that will open up more possibilities for the types of projects I can work on, whether it’s for a personal site or something more complex down the line.
