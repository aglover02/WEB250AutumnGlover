This is a simple PHP-based website that shows content based on URL routing. The index.html file is the homepage, which presents a menu of links to different lessons and a final project page. The routing logic is in router.php, which has the corresponding lesson file based on the URL path. A 404.html page is also included for invalid routes. The website is styled using the styles.css file. This webpage shows basic PHP functionality and URL routing, along with Docker integration for deployment.

In this session, I used PHP to handle user input from forms and perform calculations like unit conversions. I also practiced using PHP functions to process GET and POST requests and validate input and output results. I plan to apply this knowledge to my educational goals for web development by using these skills in future projects. Understanding server-side scripting is crucial and will open up career opportunities in backend development.


Session 4:
http://web250-env.eba-zb3tmmft.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/router.php/lesson04
In this session, I learned about using conditions and loops in PHP to create dynamic and responsive web functionality. I worked with if statements and while or for loops to handle different scenarios and repetitive tasks efficiently. This helped me understand how logic and iteration can be applied on the server side to control the behavior of web applications.
These skills are crucial for my degree in Web Development AAS and will be valuable in my future career by enabling me to write efficient, logical code for solving real-world problems in web development.


Session 5:
http://web250-env.eba-zb3tmmft.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/router.php/lesson05
In this session, I learned about handling strings and file operations. I looked into the concept of computer files; they're digital data stored in a computer system, which can be used in many formats such as reading, writing, and uploading. I also learned about the process of uploading. This lesson improved my understanding of file handling in PHP, including reading file contents, processing string data, and managing file uploads securely. I intend to apply this knowledge to my educational goals by developing web applications that need efficient data processing and user interaction through file uploads. These skills are crucial for a career in web development, where managing user data and performing server-side processing are essential aspects of it.

Session 6:
http://web250-env.eba-zb3tmmft.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/router.php/lesson06
In this session, I learned about dynamic arrays and how they work in computer science. A dynamic array is a data structure that can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed, unlike a static array that has a fixed size. I looked into concepts like capacity (the total allocated space) and logical size (the number of elements), as well as the amortized cost of resizing, which is minimized by expanding the array by a large factor, typically doubling. I also learned how dynamic arrays balance space and time complexity to handle changes in data efficiently. 
Also ignore how the navigation looks at the bottom, I'm still working on how it looks. I wanted to include navigation on all the pages.

Session 7: 
http://web250-env.eba-zb3tmmft.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/router.php/lesson07
In this session, I learned how to use PHP to process and display data from a user-uploaded file. By writing code that reads, organizes, and displays CSV data in a structured way, I got some hands-on experience handling file uploads, defining functions, sorting arrays, and integrating PHP within HTML. This knowledge is valuable as it bridges the gap between static web pages and interactive applications. I plan to apply these skills to my educational goals, such as completing my Web Development AAS, and building a strong portfolio of projects that showcase my ability to create user-driven applications. In the future, I aim to use my understanding of it to pursue a career as a web developer, where I can design efficient, data-driven solutions for real-world problems.

Session 8: 
http://web250-env.eba-zb3tmmft.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/router.php/lesson08
In this session, I learned about using PHP to handle data from external sources like Wikidata through API requests. I gained experience fetching and processing JSON data, sorting and organizing it, and presenting it dynamically in HTML. I plan to apply this knowledge in my educational journey, using server-side scripting to enhance my web development skills and build more interactive, data-driven websites. Additionally, it opens up career opportunities where I can develop backend systems, contributing to both the creative and technical aspects of web development.
