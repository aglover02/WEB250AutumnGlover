This is a simple PHP-based website that shows content based on URL routing. The index.html file is the homepage, which presents a menu of links to different lessons and a final project page. The routing logic is in router.php, which has the corresponding lesson file based on the URL path. A 404.html page is also included for invalid routes. The website is styled using the styles.css file. This webpage shows basic PHP functionality and URL routing, along with Docker integration for deployment.
